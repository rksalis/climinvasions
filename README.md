Content Overview:  
sequence_processing.R - R code used for sequence processing using the DADA2 pipeline, subsetting the data and calculating richness and evenness. 
data_analysis.R - R code used for calculating invasion success, creating the figures and performing the statistical analyses.  
asv_table_eDNA1_18S_pr2_mesocosms_vs_sp.csv - ASV table for the mesocosm samples. 
sample_data_eDNA1_18S_pr2_mesocosms_vs_sp.csv - sample metadata. 
tax_table_eDNA1_18S_pr2_mesocosms_vs_sp.csv - taxonomy table for the mesocosm samples. 
tax_table_eDNA1_18Sf_invasion_vs_sp.csv - taxonomy table for the invasion water samples. 
Richness_18S_vs_sp.csv - species richness and evenness in the mesocosms including all sampling dates, just those after the invasion and just those on the final sampling date. 
Richness_18S_vs_sp_after.csv - species richness and evenness in the mesocosms including just those after the invasion and just those on the final sampling date. 
Richness_18S_vs_sp_w22.csv - species richness and evenness in the mesocosms including just those on the final sampling date.
